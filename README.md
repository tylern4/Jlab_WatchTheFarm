#WatchTheFarm

A little python script to watch your farm jobs. Either hardcode your username
or type it into the terminal to find the jobs you have running.

##To run
Make sure you have all the requirements. You can run `pip install requirements.txt` if you use pip or check in the requirements.txt to find what you need. 

You can hardcode your username in `watchthefarm.py` to make things easier.

`$ python watchthefarm.py`
